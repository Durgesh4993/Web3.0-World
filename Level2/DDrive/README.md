### Project Description

A Decentralized file strong system in which user can store their files on IPFS network using his meta mask account and user can only access only their files using their own met mask account. All of this uploading and accessing operations will be stored on blockchain using smart contract.
We can also give access of our files other people just like drive with the help of share and owner just have to pass the sharing person public address so that they can access it.
